I’ve always had an affinity for writing, though I didn’t fully recognize it until I read Dostoevsky. His words opened something in me—an understanding that writing can be just as beautiful, perhaps even more so, than painting. Because while we see with our eyes, we truly *perceive* through our thoughts. And thoughts, in the end, are what shape our reality.

As one great man once said, “The quality of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.” That line has stayed with me. Writing helps me examine those thoughts, to see clearly what’s inside. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It doesn’t need an audience. It just needs to be *put down*. That alone brings clarity, and sometimes, peace.

In moments of weakness, I write—not because I’m trying to create something grand, but because writing is what I truly have. It’s my way of holding onto myself. And unlike other arts, writing doesn’t require much. No brushes or instruments, no perfect pitch or gallery walls. Just me, my thoughts, and the will to face them.
