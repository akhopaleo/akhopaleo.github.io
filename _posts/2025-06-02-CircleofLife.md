One of my father’s habits is cleaning the house surroundings whenever he gets free time. Back then, I was just a kid—my mind was always occupied with fantasies of never-ending summer breaks or the anticipation of Christmas holidays when summer had passed. I simply didn’t notice how often my father picked up the Dao to cut the bushes around the house, or the spade to shave the weeds off the ground.

Now, looking back, I can’t help but admire those small, seemingly unimportant and unnoticed habits of my father. These days, I find myself feeling the urge to pick up the Dao and the spade at the sight of a single weed around the house. I guess I’m my father’s son after all.

Its been sixteen years since my father passed away, and with each passing year, the memory of him fades. Yet, there are some memories of moments I shared with him that remains vivid. These are just ordinary moments, but to me, they are the most important memories of him. I want to share these memories with you, to give you the essence of who my father was.

One morning, while eating lunch after cleaning the garden with him, he said something to me after I remarked that the food seemed to taste better than usual, and I’ve always kept those words with me ever since. He said: “Everything tastes better after you’ve worked hard.” At the time, I took it to mean that food simply tastes better after you’re tired from hard work. But now, I realize it applies to life in general. Sure, you can get what you want by doing the bare minimum, but the real reward isn’t just in the result—it’s in the effort you put in, the conscience that you did something with your whole heart. That’s where the true satisfaction lies. And when your conscience is at peace, everything in life seems more pleasurable.

Another thing I remember about my father is how he liked to share quotes, sayings, or aphorisms. For instance, if we slept past the golden hour, he would proclaim, “Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise,” as we entered the kitchen to take our tea cups.

I appreciate my father’s wisdom in sharing these quotes with his still-naïve children. Instead of lecturing us—which tends to go in one ear and out the other, especially in the heat of the moment—quotes carried a sense of wisdom and were received more positively.

Marcel Proust proved my father right when he said: 

“One must never miss an opportunity of quoting things by others which are always more interesting than those one thinks up oneself.”
