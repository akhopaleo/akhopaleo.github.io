My name is Alfred Akhopa Leo. I was born and raised in Nagaland. While I may not have a long list of extraordinary accomplishments to boast about, I have graduated from NIELIT Kohima with degree in BCA. I also won a silver medal in a 3D animation competition along with my seven team members.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I'm passionate about the simple pleasures that enrich life. Music, for instance, is not just a hobby but a vital part of my existence. In my view, a world without melodies would be utterly bleak. I am a casual reader, currently captivated by the profound works of Fyodor Dostoevsky, whose intricate narratives and complex characters never cease to fascinate me.

In the distant future, which I believe will arrive sooner that we anticipate, I hope to inspire people. My goal is to motivate others to embark on their own journey of self-discovery and embrace their authentic selves.
